Using MongoDB create a data set for something of your choosing.
Perhaps pick something related to one of your hobbies etcâ€¦ where you can get data into json format for storage in a collection based database.
Using Node.js and Express create a reasonable api with at least 5 end points for interacting with your data.  At least 2 of these end points should be for retrieving (GET) data.
Using Angular, create a simple user interface (you will not be graded on how good it looks) to interact with your API.
